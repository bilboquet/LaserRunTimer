# LaserRunTimer
An Android application for Laser-Run workout.

## Introduction
Laser-Run is a sport derived from pentathlon. It is composed by the sub-assembly formed by the shooting and running.
A typical session consists of a short race for the start, then series of shooting and racing.
In each series, the competitor must make a number of shooting before resuming his race. If he fails, he can start at the expiry of the time allotted for shooting (typically 50 s).

## Goal
This application aim to provide help for people who'd like to practice in this discipline. It uses two timers, a general one which measures the running time, and one for shooting phases.

Currently, clicking on one of the two timers switches from racing mode to shooting mode. At the start of each shot, the total elapsed time is displayed.
