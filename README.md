# LaserRunTimer
An Android application for Laser-Run workout.

## Introduction
Laser-Run is a sport derived from pentathlon. It is composed by the sub-assembly formed by the shooting and running.
A typical session consists of a short race for the start, then series of shooting and racing.
In each series, the competitor must make a number of shooting before resuming his race. If he fails, he can start at the expiry of the time allotted for shooting (typically 50 s).

## Goal
This application aim to provide help for people who'd like to practice in this discipline. It uses two timers, a general one which measures the total time, and one for shooting/running phases.

## Usage
Two buttons allow the control of the timers. The first button allows to switch between shooting and running phases. The second allows to stop (/!\ at the time restart is not supported) all the timers and reset them.
A timeout of 50 second is actually set for shooting phase. When the time out is reached an alarm is played and the the timer is switched to running mode.
